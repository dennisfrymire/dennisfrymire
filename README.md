### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dennis Frymire. I'm a web developer, transitioning from a previous career in real estate sales and clinical massage therapy. (Yes, two very different fields!) As a former small business owner, I approach my work with a strong sense of ownership and empathy. 

### Now:

I am currently seeking first developer role while deepening and expanding my learning that began through self-teaching and General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.
