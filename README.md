### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dennis Frymire. I'm a web developer, transitioning from a previous career in real estate sales and clinical massage therapy. (Yes, two very different fields!) I approach my work with a strong sense of ownership and empathy. 

### Now:

Seeking new opportunities as my family has recently relocated from Chicago to the St. Louis East Metro area.
